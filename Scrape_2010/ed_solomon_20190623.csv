1519,384,[],False,8002,So a scammer hacked my friend’s FB and reached out to me. I managed to keep him on the hook all morning. The following is my conversation with him - verbatim.,@ed_solomon
78,,[],False,795,It is 100% real. This is EXACTLY how he talks. If you Venmo me $250 I can set him up with FaceTime so you guys can chat.,@ed_solomon
104,45,[],False,1062,"Tonally Face The Music is closer to Excellent Adventure than Bogus Journey, but w the weight - & experience - & the life of joys & losses - that age brings. The best comedy, to me, is absurdity rooted in human truth. That's our goal, at least. Did we hit it? Guess we'll find out.",@ed_solomon
161,,[],False,867,"We named the Martian ""Station"" cause of a typo. We were SO punch drunk - it was 3 AM & we were begrudgingly doing studio notes, & we'd just cut out an entire sequence we loved at the police station - but some reason I'd left the word ""Station"" left over from INT. STATION - DAY.",@ed_solomon
14,,[],False,470,"The very first thing I’d ever had produced - an episode of Laverne and Shirley - was directed by @MJMcKean and starred, among others, @DavidLLander. (Carrie Fisher was also in that episode.) Only line I recall: “Hello I’m Playboy Squiggy.” HAPPY BIRTHDAY!",@ed_solomon

In honor of that (& to keep some promises), I'd like to share a few things over the month. The image below is the first (and ONLY) time Chris & I did Bill & Ted in front of an audience - early 1983 at the UCLA Comedy Club.",@ed_solomon
21,,[],False,558,"My father died in 1992 after a long illness. One of the last things he ever said to me was ""be excellent to each other...but party on"" thank you ed and chris",@AlmaJA11
11,,[],False,319,"Our original concept was a standard, typical Martian - little green man kind of thing. It was (director) Pete Hewitt's idea to make him two creatures that run together to form one.",@ed_solomon
20,,[],False,380,"Chris & I, totally fried, just started saying EVERY line as if it was ""Station."" ""Staaaaation,"" ""StaySHUNN,"" ""Stasshshshshshshshsunn."" And then we decided no matter WHAT happens, we're gonna have a Martian name Station. And worse: we're gonna dig our heels in on it.",@ed_solomon
34,,[],False,290,"All I could remember is that we messed up the end of Bogus Journey in the script, and that at one point we had something better, though I forgot what it was. Here is the great @winter explaining to me what I'd forgotten.",@ed_solomon
18,,[],False,309,Script now by Chris Matheson & Ed Solomon & Matt Lee.,@ed_solomon
12,,[],False,302,"That said, I respect the *ambition* in Bogus Journey (which was originally called Bill and Ted Go To Hell, but they made us change it) - we just didn’t get the script right in the third act. (Though @Winter tells me we once had a version that was right.. till we hadda change it.)",@ed_solomon
10,,[],False,364,There's an element of darkness in BJ that I think crossed the line a tad too much. I think the blend in this one is better - and there are many *other* colors as well.. mostly due to all of us having lived life and grown up.,@ed_solomon
149,,[],False,797,"Yes. For several years I'd had the ""J"" (Will Smith - who was as yet upcast) character be the eyes into the movie. But then when Tommy Lee Jones - who'd just won the Oscar for The Fugitive - was cast (he was the first on board), there became a scramble to make him the ""lead.""",@ed_solomon
3,,[],False,176,"(By the way - I recently read that very memo. It was brimming with the self-righteous hubris of one w/out the wisdom or experience (or temperament - yet) to recognize that just cause someone disagrees with you, they're not necessary ""wrong."" I don't blame em for being pissed.)",@ed_solomon
44,,[],False,388,"I spent two weeks on a rewrite - then a couple weeks a month later on set. It was chaotic and confusing, and they didn't use much of what I wrote. I think I only got credit cause I was on vacation when the arbitration happened and no one else wanted it.",@ed_solomon
8,,[],False,438,"Anyways I came back on. (Then was fired again and rehired, maybe even two more times.) Two weeks into production, Barry said to me ""I think Tommy finally figured out he was in a comedy."" I think the fact that he didn't know is what him so great in it. And he was great, I thought.",@ed_solomon
4,,[],False,254,"That memo became the basis for the rewrite I did. By then Will had been cast - off my first script (pre being fired) & he was like ""Wait, what happened to the tone? The tone is the thing that made all the other shit work."" (He had only been in 6 Degrees of Separation at that pt.)",@ed_solomon
5,,[],False,244,"Anyways, I was fired, and they made a drama out of it. I read it, and wrote a ten page memo about what I thought was wrong, and why. Later (after I'd been rehired), Barry Sonnenfeld said to me: ""That memo? That memo is what got you MORE fired.""",@ed_solomon
18,,[],False,402,"I told him it wasn't good enough science fiction to be drama. That it needed the kinds of leaps of faith that a comedy allows. (I believed then - and do now - that the *mood* of a film, a very under-discussed concept, is the thing that determines what we'll buy and not buy.)",@ed_solomon
4,,[],False,241,"I wasn't really sure why he'd said it - I didn't really know why blending science fiction and comedy made me an ""asshole."" But he'd also brought up (in the first 10 minutes) that he was Al Gore's roommate at Harvard, which seemed equally, I don't know... the same.",@ed_solomon
3,,[],False,205,"Okay, it was ""asshole.""",@ed_solomon
5,,[],False,193,"But they needed him to feel like it was ""his"" movie. This was also exacerbated by our first meeting, where he told me, in no nuanced terms, that it needed to be either ""a comedy or science fiction, make up your mind,___"" (He used an expletive.)",@ed_solomon
5,,[],False,181,"Partly it was due to the fact that he was a big ""star"" at the time. I disagreed, feeling like it was better to go into the world through the eyes of a neophyte, rather than one who ""knew"" everything. It threw off my whole balance, tbh; I wanted to discover his world gradually.",@ed_solomon

95,39,[],False,1186,"Watching MiB 4 was surreal - like going to meet, for the very first time, an adult child you apparently fathered but didn't raise, or even know about.
