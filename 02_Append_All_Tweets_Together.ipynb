      "That said, I respect the *ambition* in Bogus Journey (which was originally called Bill and Ted Go To Hell, but they made us change it) - we just didn’t get the script right in the third act. (Though tells me we once had a version that was right.. till we hadda change it.)\n",

      "(By the way - I recently read that very memo. It was brimming with the self-righteous hubris of one w/out the wisdom or eerience (or temperament - yet) to recognize that just cause someone disagrees with you, they're not necessary \"wrong.\" I don't blame em for being pissed.)\n",
      "I spent two weeks on a rewrite - then a couple weeks a month later on set. It was chaotic and confusing, and they didn't use much of what I wrote. I think I only got credit cause I was on vacation when the arbitration happened and no one else wanted it.\n",
      "Anyways I came back on. (Then was fired again and rehired, maybe even two more times.) Two weeks into production, Barry said to me \"I think Tommy finally figured out he was in a comedy.\" I think the fact that he didn't know is what him so great in it. And he was great, I thought.\n",
      "That memo became the basis for the rewrite I did. By then Will had been cast - off my first script (pre being fired) & he was like \"Wait, what happened to the tone? The tone is the thing that made all the other shit work.\" (He had only been in Degrees of Separation at that pt.)\n",
      "Anyways, I was fired, and they made a drama out of it. I read it, and wrote a ten page memo about what I thought was wrong, and why. Later (after I'd been rehired), Barry Sonnenfeld said to me: \"That memo? That memo is what got you MORE fired.\"\n",
      "I told him it wasn't good enough science fiction to be drama. That it needed the kinds of leaps of faith that a comedy allows. (I believed then - and do now - that the *mood* of a film, a very under-discussed concept, is the thing that determines what we'll buy and not buy.)\n",
      "I wasn't really sure why he'd said it - I didn't really know why blending science fiction and comedy made me an \"asshole.\" But he'd also brought up (in the first minutes) that he was Al Gore's roommate at Harvard, which seemed equally, I don't know... the same.\n",
      "Okay, it was \"asshole.\"\n",
      "But they needed him to feel like it was \"his\" movie. This was also exacerbated by our first meeting, where he told me, in no nuanced terms, that it needed to be either \"a comedy or science fiction, make up your mind,___\" (He used an eletive.)\n",
      "Partly it was due to the fact that he was a big \"star\" at the time. I disagreed, feeling like it was better to go into the world through the eyes of a neophyte, rather than one who \"knew\" everything. It threw off my whole balance, tbh; I wanted to discover his world gradually.\n",
